# Clustering Analysis of Iris Data Set: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning

The goal of this study is to explore the iris dataset via exploratory data analysis and conduct clustering analysis. Supervised (i.e., k nearest neighbor - KNN) and Unsupervised learning (k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering) approaches are employed in the classification of the data.

**Statistical Techniques**

Exploratory data analysis and clustering analysis:
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Supervised Learning - KNN
* Unsupervised Learning - K-means clustering and Hierarchical clustering

**Project**

R was used for the coding and the creation of the project which can be found here: [R Script](https://github.com/saidatsanni/Analysis-of-Iris-Data-Set-using-Supervised-and-Unsupervised-Learning-Techniques/blob/116d3307a82ff775e22852b46286e499f2de831e/Main/Supervised%20and%20Unsupervised%20Learning_IrisData.R) and [Final Project](https://github.com/saidatsanni/Analysis-of-Iris-Data-Set-using-Supervised-and-Unsupervised-Learning-Techniques/blob/116d3307a82ff775e22852b46286e499f2de831e/Main/Supervised%20and%20Unsupervised%20Learning_IrisData.pdf)
