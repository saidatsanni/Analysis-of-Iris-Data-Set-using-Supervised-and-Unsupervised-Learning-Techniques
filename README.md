# Analysis of Iris Data Set: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning

The goal of this study is to explore the iris dataset via exploratory data analysis and the incorporation of some machine learning algorithms. Supervised (i.e., k nearest neighbor) and unsupervised learning (k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering) approaches are employed in the classification of the data.

**Statistical Techniques**

We consider exploratory data analysis and clustering analysis:
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Supervised Learning - KNN
* Unsupervised Learning - K-means clustering and Hierarchical clustering

**Project**

R was used for the coding and the creation of the project which can be found here: [Data Modeling with Splines and GAM](https://rpubs.com/Saidat/B-Splines-and-GAM)
